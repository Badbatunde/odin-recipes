      Steps
    </h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Fill a pan or skillet about 2 inches deep with oil and heat over
        medium-high flame for about 5 minutes. The oil will start "moving" when
        it's ready.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Meanwhile, skin and cut plantain into slices about 1-inch thick or based
        on your preference.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Add plantain slices to hot oil to cook. Depending on your pan size,
        you'll likely have to cook in batches to avoid crowding the pan
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Allow the slices to cook for about 5 minutes then flip. The bottoms of
        each slice should be golden brown, if not, flip back and cook a bit
        longer. <br />
        Repeat on the opposite side then remove dodo from oil and place onto a
        plate.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>Repeat with remaining slices until finished. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
