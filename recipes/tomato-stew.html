      Steps
    </h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        To start with, wash and cut the tomatoes into quarters. Then, put the
        tomatoes in a large saucepan along with chopped ginger,<br />
        chopped garlic, garam masala and green chilies which have been split
        into two. To this, add water and the bay leaf. Bring this <br />
        mixture to a boil on medium flame then simmer for about 20 minutes or
        until the tomatoes have are mashed completely. <br />
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Next, strain this boiled mixture through a sieve. This will give us a
        smooth tomato soup, infused with the taste of the spices.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Heat oil in a pan on medium flame and add cumin seeds. Let the seeds
        splutter. Then add the strained tomato mixture to this. <br />
        Season it with salt and bring this to a boil.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        If the stew is extremely sour, put half a teaspoon of sugar to balance
        the taste. Garnish it with coriander leaves before serving.
      </li>
